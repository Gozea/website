      <description>Making a website is not that hard nowaday depending on the tools you use. Making a pretty website, or at least a readable one is hard, especially when you have no clue about what your doing like me.
This website is not very pretty but it would be even worse without these tools I&amp;rsquo;m gonna present.
Fontawesome If you visited the home page of this website (Le Salon), you may or may not have clicked on the button at the very beginning that invites you to add some decorations on the first screen so you can make yourself confortable.</description>

      <description>Honestly I&amp;rsquo;m not very knowledgeable when in comes to litterature but here that some books I read in school or in my personal time that I really liked
Les Miserables Like all french middle schooler I had to read this book. Even though I read it as an assignement, I really liked it as a kid. Characters are great and a great story overall
Of Mices and Men This one was also an assignement but I legitimately cried at the end of this book.</description>
