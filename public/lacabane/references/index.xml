      <description>Making a website is not that hard nowaday depending on the tools you use. Making a pretty website, or at least a readable one is hard, especially when you have no clue about what your doing like me.
This website is not very pretty but it would be even worse without these tools I&amp;rsquo;m gonna present.
Fontawesome If you visited the home page of this website (Le Salon), you may or may not have clicked on the button at the very beginning that invites you to add some decorations on the first screen so you can make yourself confortable.</description>
