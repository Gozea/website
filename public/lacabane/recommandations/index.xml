      <description>Visual Novels Zero escape A trilogy. The two first games are some of the best visual novels I ever played. Reall well-written tension and characters.
Danganronppa Really nice humours with some nice written investigations.
Party games 100% Orange Juice Super fun and super random with friends</description>

      <description>Honestly I&amp;rsquo;m not very knowledgeable when in comes to litterature but here that some books I read in school or in my personal time that I really liked
Les Miserables Like all french middle schooler I had to read this book. Even though I read it as an assignement, I really liked it as a kid. Characters are great and a great story overall
Of Mices and Men This one was also an assignement but I legitimately cried at the end of this book.</description>
