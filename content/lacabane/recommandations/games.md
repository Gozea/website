# Visual Novels

### Zero escape

A trilogy. The two first games are some of the best visual novels I ever played. Reall well-written tension and characters.

### Danganronppa

Really nice humours with some nice written investigations.

# Party games

### 100% Orange Juice

Super fun and super random with friends
