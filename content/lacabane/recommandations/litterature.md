Honestly I'm not very knowledgeable when in comes to litterature but here that some books I read in school or in my personal time that I really liked

## Les Miserables

Like all french middle schooler I had to read this book. Even though I read it as an assignement, I really liked it as a kid. Characters are great and a great story overall

## Of Mices and Men

This one was also an assignement but I legitimately cried at the end of this book.

## The Royal Assassin

A fantasy book I read in my teenage years.
